Ingredients
250 grams of salt cod
1 medium sweet onion (or 3 shallots), diced small
4 tablespoons of flour
A pinch of nutmeg
About 3 cups of whole milk (at room temperature!)
3 T unsalted butter
Extra Virgin Olive Oil
Salt
Black pepper
2-3 beaten eggs
Bread crumbs

Instructions
1. When working with salt cod, you will first need to desalt it. This is done by soaking the cod for at least 24 hours in cold water, changing the water at least five or six times.
2. After soaking, shred the cod into small pieces, try to not allow any bones to sneak through!
3. Add 2 T of olive oil to your pan and sauté the diced onion for about 10 minutes. When the onion is completely tender and translucent, add the shredded cod and some black pepper.
4. Sauté for a few minutes and then take off the heat and reserve.
5. To make the béchamel sauce, first sift the flour to avoid lumps.
6. Next, in a large, heavy pan over a medium heat, add the butter and allow it to melt.
7. When it turns light brown and starts to foam, add the sifted flour to make a roux (a flour/fat mixture).
8. Constantly stirring, cook the roux until it becomes a nice sandy brown color and forms a ball.
9. Whisk in one cup of milk and while constantly stirring, add the pepper and nutmeg.
10. When the roux has absorbed the first cup of milk, add the other two and stir for about 5 more minutes until you have a dough with a good consistency.
11. Finally, add in the cod and onion mixture and mix well.
12. Let the dough cool to room temperature and then refrigerate overnight.
13. The next day, make small balls or logs with your hands and pass them through beaten egg and then breadcrumbs.
14. Deep fry your cod croquettes in hot oil and enjoy these crispy treats!
