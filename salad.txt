Ingredients
30 grams (1 ounce) dry mixed seaweed
1 tablespoon + 1 teaspoon rice vinegar
1 tablespoon toasted sesame oil
1 tablespoon soy sauce
1 tablespoon sugar (you can substitute a 1/2 tablespoon agave)
1/2 teaspoon salt (to taste)
1/2 teaspoon ginger juice
1 tablespoon toasted sesame seeds
1 scallion, finely chopped

Directions
Put the dry seaweed in a large bowl and fill it with cold water. If you like your seaweed crunchy, soak it for 5 minutes, if you like it more tender, soak it for 10 minutes.
To make the dressing, combine the rice vinegar, sesame oil, soy sauce, sugar, salt and ginger juice in a small bowl and whisk together.
Drain the seaweed and use your hands to squeeze out excess water. Wipe out any excess water in the bowl, and then return the seaweed along with the dressing and sesame seeds. Toss thoroughly to combine. Plate the salad and garnish with scallions.
